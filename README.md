How to interact with the work

Open the index.html file in a browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended).

At first, you will see a static composition of colourful wheels and bead chains.

Click the “Play/Pause” button at the bottom of the window to start the audio.

As the music plays, the wheels start rotating, the bead rings and bead arcs grow and shrink in time with the audio, and the background dots “breathe” with the overall volume.

Press R to regenerate a new random arrangement of wheels and bead arcs.

Press Shift + R to regenerate the same layout using the current random seed.

Press S to save the current frame as a PNG image.
